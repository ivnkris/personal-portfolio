            Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm Kris Ivan, current University of
            Birmingham full-stack web development coding bootcamp student (which
            is admittedly a mouthful). My passion for computers and Information
            Technology in general started at a young age and I have taken some
            extra classes in high school to learn about algorithm theory and
            coding with compiled languages, notably Turbo Pascal. Life came in
            the way afterwards though and I ended up graduating from the
            University of Brighton with a Business Management with Economics
            degree in 2018. Since then I have worked in project management and
            operational management in the utilities sector, however the Covid-19
            pandemic has given a great chance to gain additional skills, so I've
            decided to re-train as a software engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I'm proficient in HTML and CSS, including the concept of
            accessibility and building responsive websites. By the end of the
            bootcamp however I'm expecting to know vanilla Javascript and the
            MERN stack in detail to tackle both front-end and back-end
            challenges. It will most definitely not be the end of the learning
            journey though as I would like to learn php and Python after
            graduation and I'm sure that new technologies and frameworks will be
            developed and implemented in the near future, so I'm also keen to
            keep up with best practices and workplace trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among my hobbies, I'm an aspiring music producer with a small home
            studio (a bit too soon to look for my stuff on iTunes though, haha)
            and a craft beer afficionado, also brewing my own ales on the
            kitchen stove (they are better than they sound based on the set-up
            though, I promise). And having lived in 5 different countries, I'm
            always up for exploring new places and being exposed to different
            cultures. There is so much to see on this planet and so much to
            learn from each other!
